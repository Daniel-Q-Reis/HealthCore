# Project Status

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Current State

The foundational setup of the project is complete. This includes:
- A robust, multi-stage Docker setup for development and production.
- A comprehensive CI pipeline in GitHub Actions that performs linting, type checking, security scanning, and runs tests against live database and cache services.
- A fully configured Dev Container for a consistent and isolated development experience.
- Branch protection rules are in place for `main` and `develop` to ensure code quality and stability.

## Next Steps

With the core infrastructure stable, we are now ready to begin implementing the first feature from the **Priority 1** list in our Roadmap (GEMINI.md).
