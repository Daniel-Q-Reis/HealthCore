# Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2024-10-26
**Owner:** Daniel Reis

## Current State

The foundational setup of the project is complete. This includes:
- A robust, multi-stage Docker setup for development and production.
- A comprehensive CI pipeline in GitHub Actions that performs linting, type checking, security scanning, and runs tests against live database and cache services.
- A fully configured Dev Container for a consistent and isolated development experience.
- Branch protection rules are in place for `main` and `develop` to ensure code quality and stability.

## In Progress

**Task:** Implement Detailed Health Check Endpoints
- **Owner:** Daniel Reis
- **Branch:** `feature/healthchecks/detailed-probes`
- **Description:** Add `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints to check application status and connectivity to downstream services (Database, Cache). This is a foundational step for Kubernetes readiness and observability.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A `GET` request to `/health/live` returns `200 OK`.
  - A `GET` request to `/health/ready` returns `200 OK` if all dependencies (DB, Redis) are reachable, and `503 Service Unavailable` otherwise.
